                <br>
                <p class="pre">Mr. Murry's IST class consisted of many different computer-based projects. We learned about the parts of a computer all the way to how to set up your own Ununtuu server. If you're looking for an increase in your awareness of computers and technology, this is a great class for you. Mr Murry makes it very fun to learn.</p>

                <p class="pre">HTML was like, super important in our freshman class at McIntosh High School. We learned all about it from our awesome teacher, Mr. Murry. He was so great, you know? HTML helped us make websites and stuff, and it was all about tags and stuff. It was kinda confusing at first, but Mr. Murry broke it down for us. I can't wait to build my own website with HTML, it's gonna be so cool!</p>
                    
                <p class="pre">Ugh, those coding CodeHS assignments were, like, so annoying in our freshman class at McIntosh High School. We had to do all these tasks and stuff, and it was all about coding and programming. I mean, come on, who wants to sit there and write lines of code all day? Mr. Murry, as much as I like him, assigned so many of those projects. It was kinda overwhelming at times, and I just wanted to take a break and do something fun. But hey, I guess coding is important and all that. Still, I'm glad we're done with those assignments now.</p>
