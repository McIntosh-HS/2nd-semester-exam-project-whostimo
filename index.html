            <p class="pre">My Website is a lackluster attempt at web design, created by yours truly. The layout is uninspiring, with a generic header and navigation bar that fails to engage visitors. The content itself is haphazardly presented, lacking cohesion and aesthetic appeal. Overall, it's a forgettable website that I can't help but be disappointed with.</p>
            <p class="pre">The languages page, part of the underwhelming "Final Exam" project, showcases a table of programming languages. The design is uninspired and lacks any visually appealing elements. The table itself provides basic information about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, but fails to engage or provide any meaningful context. It's just another dull addition to an overall disappointing website.</p>
            <p class="pre">The last page contains lame content of the IST class that can be summerized as follows, "Mr. Murry's IST class at McIntosh High School offered a diverse range of computer-based projects, covering topics from computer hardware to setting up a personal Ubuntu server. With Mr. Murry's engaging teaching style, the class provided an enjoyable and educational experience for students looking to enhance their knowledge of computers and technology. Although HTML played a crucial role in our curriculum, initially posing some confusion, Mr. Murry's guidance helped us understand the fundamentals and sparked excitement for creating our own websites. However, the abundance of coding CodeHS assignments proved tedious and overwhelming, yet ultimately emphasized the importance of coding skills." (I used ChatGPT to summerize it, lmao.)</p>
